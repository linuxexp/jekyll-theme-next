<p>I needed to do a file upload to a server through a GUI desktop application and at the same time update a GUI element about progress so this is how it is done, I thought to share the idea with you.<!--more--></p>
<pre>POST /path-to-your-file.php HTTP/1.1
Host: www.my-domain.com
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=9afb0c26-7adf-11e0-b167-1c6f65955350
Content-Length: (length of every thing after this in bytes including new line characters)

--9afb0c26-7adf-11e0-b167-1c6f65955350
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="name of a post variable"

Variable data
--9afb0c26-7adf-11e0-b167-1c6f65955350
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="name of another post variable"

Another variable data
--9afb0c26-7adf-11e0-b167-1c6f65955350
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="name of file variable"; filename="name of the file"
Content-Type: (application/octet-stream or mime type)

our binary data
--9afb0c26-7adf-11e0-b167-1c6f65955350--</pre>
<p>There's nothing much to it, you send a POST HTTP request to server in the form shown above</p>
<p>Note</p>
<ul>
<li>boundary should any unique text, that determines the boundary of the parts</li>
<li>- - determines that this isn't the last part, - - boundary - - determines the last part/ end of request</li>
<li>Blank lines in the above request aren't meant of code cleanliness, they should be there, A blank line must be there between the content headers and the content</li>
<li>After end of the request, aka after - - boundary - -, there should be another blank line</li>
<li>The EOL character is 'rn' according official HTTP documentation, but all major servers are also happy with a single newline character 'n'</li>
</ul>
