<div style="text-align:left;" dir="ltr">I was going through my backups and I found this simple filesystem driver I wrote in 2009, this prevents mount of removable disks{usb_mass_storage...}, This driver was a spinoff of the driver Spysym007 file filtering driver, i was developing.<!--more--><a name="more"></a><br />
Maybe this could be useful to persons who want to prevents removable data disk on a windows machine, like cafes, public PCs, schools etc, but at the same allow other usb devices like webcam etc.</p>
