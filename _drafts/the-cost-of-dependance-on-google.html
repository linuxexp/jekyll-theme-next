<blockquote>We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces. -- Carl Sagan</p></blockquote>
<p>Before I say anything, I want to clear one thing that I don't hate Google, The views presented in this article is clearly those experienced by me. I am person who supports Open-source and free speech. I am frequent contributor to Open-source world. Google is great for its search service, no other search service comes even near to it. Google has array of great service which are mostly available for free. But there is a dangerous trend that's going on for past some years. It's like Google says something does something else.</p>
<p><!--more-->Google ad choice makes it clear that It wouldn't tolerate spamming, click fraud, make for adsense kind things, the Google policies are very strict for publishers, the moment you may deviate from the TOS, they will get you and will disable you forever. But you can often see adword approved advertisements that supports scams, hatred etc, which clearly shows Google's double standards.</p>
<p><strong>Cost of dependence on Google</strong></p>
<p>Taking your online work completely to Google is one the worse things that you could probably do, Google now isn't merely a company, It has grown to become a culture.  When you know that so many people are depending on you, so heavily,  not only individuals but business, then you must have some accountability. if you ever read a Google TOS, you know what I am talking about.</p>
<p><code>Update 2012: Google released its Google drive, free cloud storage for everyone, wanna put your stuff in it??</code></p>
<p>If you got your account disabled then you may try you luck to contact a real customer care,  other than that It'll mostly be automated replies. You can save yourself from the day when Google may disable your account, though it's rare but when it happens, the persons knows how much it sucks to have your complete Google account disabled. You could for example have multiple Google accounts for multiple Google services,  there is even a nice Firefox extension for purpose of switching between different Google account with ease. But I will only encourage people to not to rely completely on single service be it any.  There are some vey nice and high quality alternative available for free as discussed below.</p>
<p><strong>Google crushes free speech</strong></p>
<p>One side Google openly supports Open source world, free speech on internet and so, and on the other hand Google crushes free speech. I was going though Google adsense agreement and I read some thing like this, if you place adsense advertisements on pages that devalues google/ google products, google reputation, you are violating adsense TOS. Since adsense own like 65% of online advertisement, does that means that those 65% websites can't raise voice against Google or its service, correct me on this If you think I am wrong.</p>
<p>Google supports open internet, because that's how it gets revenue, because of that Google can index whatever, show whatever content in his adsense.</p>
<p><strong>Google doesn't care about Open-source</strong></p>
<p>It has going on for a while, Google brings a open-source project and degrades it, The famous android is the worse mobile OS, a bloatware,  Symbian mobile OS is far better, Meego is great. If I have describe android, i would do it like, android is a mobile OS purely build for Google advertisement. Forgive me I never used android and will never, but I know things, I have experience in doing kernel level development in both windows and linux. Android sucks at power management, though Google did alot on that side. Google isn't  quite aggressive in getting their changes in main stream linux kernel. When Google android development team was asked about it, they replied, they are too busy in android development.  If you want to know in detail about difference in linux and android kernel, here's a nice link [<a href="http://ranganaths.wordpress.com/2010/07/03/android-kernel-and-linux-kernel/">http://ranganaths.wordpress.com/2010/07/03/android-kernel-and-linux-kernel/</a>]. Though I never used android I am sure, android comes fully loaded with Google services,  Android sends alot of User specific data back to Google servers, so they can improve their services, If your mobile comes with geo tagging features, Google Image search is there to take its advantage,  if your mobile comes with GPS, Google Adsense is there to provide you location specific ads.  You can read about, how much android actually cares about user's privacy, in this wikipedia article [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29#Criticism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29#Criticism</a>]</p>
<p><strong>There is no individuality on Youtube</strong></p>
<p>The you-tube has come to a point where "You" in youtube has become meaningless,  Youtube now isn't about people, It has become a businesses game, and is in control of big media industries.</p>
<blockquote><p>In July 2008, Viacom won a court ruling requiring YouTube to hand over data detailing the viewing habits of every user who has watched videos on the site. The move led to concerns that the viewing habits of individual users could be identified through a combination of their IP addresses and log in names</p></blockquote>
<p>Thinking about mailing a sensitive report or something to your college, thinking about GMail, forgot it.</p>
<p>Do you ever realized that Gmail displays ads related to your email content . This isn't possible if Google Adsense doesn't have a copy about the content. GMail is the first choice for many people, many officials who deal with very sensitive information use Gmail. Caching User's email content isn't a good idea Google!</p>
<p>How can I say that the content is being cached? Google says it, "To provide better search and services, we store user specific data in our servers temporarily", how long? nobody knows. You can see it yourself, for example open a website/blog which uses adsense to display ads, note the kind of ads are being displayed, then visit some websites/blogs about off-topic in new tab, then come back to the previous blog window, refresh it, you'll see ads being displayed related to things that you visited using Google search or from websites that uses adsense.</p>
<p><strong>Moving out from Google</strong></p>
<p>I have started to move out from Google's domain,  I can't leave Google search,  no doubts about it. But for other things I could try, I have moved from Gmail to Zoho, from blogger to wordpress, The only Google services I am using is Google search, though I tried ducky for a while.</p>
<p>Wait, there is much more to come with Google cloud computing &amp; chromium OS, Cloud computing is only good for businesses, not for individuals, especially power users.  If ever, cloud related OS replaces current systems,  that would be end of Open source world and free speech.</p>
